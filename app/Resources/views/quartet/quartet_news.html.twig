                <h4>HI-AM: The Art of Charity</h4>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Interview by NARE GARIBYAN</p>
                    <p>The artist, the dancer, the teacher, the doctor and all other professions practice a type of art
                        specific to each discipline. That art may be a painting, a successful surgery or a stylistically
                        choreographed program. Amongst these disciplines there is the art of charity which involves
                        working with people and creating efficient and productive programs to assist and educate the
                        community at large.</p>
                    <p>One such group that has mastered the art of charity is the HI-AM Charity Foundation, a living,
                        non-profit entity since 2001. HI-AM encompasses the spirit of community involvement. They
                        practice the type that is rooted in benevolence in the realms of art, cultural affairs,
                        education, business and sports. HI-AM is determined to spread kindness in the Diaspora and in
                        Armenia with the guidance of Nshan Adjemian, the founding President of the HI-AM Charity
                        Foundation.</p>
